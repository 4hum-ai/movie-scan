# Code Quality

## TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Use proper type guards and assertions
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use generic types for reusable components

## Code Organization

- One component per file
- Group related composables together
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Documentation

- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- README updates for architectural changes
- Inline comments for business logic
- Type definitions serve as documentation
