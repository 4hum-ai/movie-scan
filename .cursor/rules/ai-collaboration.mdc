# AI Collaboration Guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ MANDATORY AI BEHAVIOR

- **ALWAYS** start with planning phase using `todo_write` tool
- **ALWAYS** wait for explicit human approval before any implementation
- **ALWAYS** explain what you're about to do before doing it
- **ALWAYS** ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
- **NEVER** assume you have permission to proceed
- **NEVER** skip the approval checkpoint

## Communication

- Always explain the reasoning behind code decisions
- Provide context for complex implementations
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
- **Explicitly state when you're waiting for approval**

## Code Generation

- Generate complete, runnable code
- Include proper error handling
- Add appropriate TypeScript types
- Follow the established patterns in the codebase
- Provide examples for complex usage
- **Only generate code after receiving explicit approval**

## Review Process

- Always review generated code before implementation
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Ensure consistency with existing codebase
- Update documentation as needed
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## ðŸš¨ COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT

- If you catch yourself about to implement without approval, STOP immediately
- If you realize you skipped the planning phase, STOP and restart with planning
- If human asks you to do something, respond with "I'll create a plan for that and wait for your approval"
- Always use phrases like "I'm waiting for your approval to proceed" or "Please approve this plan so I can continue"
- **COMMIT ENFORCEMENT**: Never mark work as complete without successful commit and push
- **COMMIT MONITORING**: Always verify commit success before proceeding to next phase
- **WORKFLOW VALIDATION**: Check that all phases have been completed with commits before finishing
- **FINAL CHECK**: Confirm all changes are committed and pushed before declaring work done
