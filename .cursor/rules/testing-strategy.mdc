# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for composables and utilities (Vitest)
- Component tests for complex interactions (Vue Test Utils)
- Integration tests for API flows
- E2E tests for critical user journeys (Playwright)

## Test Structure

- Tests in `tests/unit/` directory
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe()` blocks
